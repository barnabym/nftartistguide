# What is an NFT?

NFT stands for non-fungible token. Basically a digital good. In terms of Art, it means an artwork like an image such as a still image file, gif, 3d file, or video can be 'minted' (created with an identifier) on a 'blockchain' (kind of like a database or a ledger). Sometimes the file can be stored or referenced on a blockchain such as IPFS or Arweave.

Here are some links to some video explainers:
